# Pagefile Parasites

**ParasiteView** is a fileless injection technique that executes a PE payload from a memory section backed by the system pagefile. No files are dropped. No classic API calls. No noise.

---

## ðŸ”§ Technique Overview

This PoC uses the following Windows syscalls:

- `NtCreateSection` with `SEC_COMMIT` and `FileHandle = NULL` â†’ pagefile-backed memory
- `NtMapViewOfSection` in the current process â†’ write payload
- `NtMapViewOfSection` in suspended remote process â†’ inject payload
- `NtUnmapViewOfSection` â†’ unmap original image
- `SetThreadContext` â†’ patch `RIP` to payload entrypoint
- `ResumeThread` â†’ execute

---

## âœ… Features

- Single PowerShell file, no external dependencies
- No `VirtualAllocEx`, no `WriteProcessMemory`, no `CreateRemoteThread`
- Payload stays in memory only
- EDR-unfriendly by design

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Payload must be a valid PE file (e.g. raw `exe`) smaller than 2MB
- Target binary must exist (e.g. `notepad.exe`)
- EntryPoint is extracted from the PE header manually
